# mellea-resume-readiness

FIU Student Mellea Project: Resume Skills-Gap Analyzer

Compare a resume against a real job posting and see exactly which skills are missing — plus suggestions to close the gap. Built with Mellea so every "(missing) skill" is grounded in the actual postings, never made up.

## Setup

### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.11+**. uv can install it for you if you don't have it.
- **[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)**, the Python package and environment manager:
  ```bash
  # macOS / Linux
  curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
  # Windows (PowerShell)
  powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
  ```
- **An LLM backend**: [Ollama](https://ollama.com) running an IBM Granite model locally, or a hosted Granite endpoint.

### Install
```bash
git clone https://github.com/swith004/mellea-resume-readiness.git   # or your fork
cd mellea-resume-readiness
uv sync          # creates .venv with Python 3.11 and installs Mellea from uv.lock
```

### Verify
```bash
uv run main.py
# -> mellea-resume-readiness is set up. Mellea version: 0.8.0
```

### Backend (Ollama + Granite)
```bash
ollama pull granite4.2:3b     # default model used by mellea.start_session()
ollama serve                  # if Ollama isn't already running
```

### Day-to-day
- Run anything inside the environment with `uv run <command>`, or activate it with `source .venv/bin/activate` (Windows: `.venv\Scripts\activate`).
- Add a dependency with `uv add <package>`. This updates `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock`, so commit both.
- No uv? Plain pip works too: `python3.11 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate && pip install mellea`.
